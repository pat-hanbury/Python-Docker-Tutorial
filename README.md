# Python-Docker-Tutorial
Intro Tutorial for ["How to Launch Docker Containers with the Official Python Library"](https://www.medium.com).

## How to Use this Repo
The IPython notebook `dockerize.ipynb` is intended to server as a standalone example. After _pip_ installing the requirements, you should be able to run all the cells of the notebook and launch the example _Django To Do_ app.

The file `dockerize.py` is an example of what the final product should look like after you complete the tutorial.

## References
In this tutorial, we use Docker to launch a To Do app, developed by Ronald Huggler. You can find his repository [here](https://github.com/rHuggler/django-todo).
